            <p>A cock ring is a ring worn around the penis, usually at the base. The primary purpose of wearing a cock ring is to restrict the flow of blood from the erect penis in order to produce a stronger erection or to maintain an erection for a longer period of time.</p>

It’s a toy that not only increases pleasure for men, but also does the same for their partner and increases the overall quality of sex making it one of the most sought after toys out there.

            <h3><strong>Thin Condoms</strong></h3>
            <p>The thumb rule of safe sex is using condoms - but some of you may complaint that condoms stops that &#x27;real&#x27; feeling during sex, while some of you may struggle to finish while wrapped-up, and simply can&#x27;t orgasm.

            <h3><strong>Ribbed/Dotted Condoms</strong></h3>
            <p>Ribbed condoms have a surface texture that consists of small raised ridges that run around the circumference of the condom. Some have deep undulating ribs, others have a narrower ribbing effect. They work by increasing the friction for the wearer and therefore helping to intensify the sensation around the penis, but it doesn&#x27;t stop there - the added texture of ribbed condoms also provides your partner with extra stimulation and a variety of feeling that you simply don&#x27;t get with un-textured alternatives.</p>
            <p>Dotted condoms consist of a series of bumpy, circular dots that occur all over the surface of the condom. Similar to ribbed, the dotted pattern creates an increased friction but with an added intense excitement for both you and your partner thanks to the slightly rougher and varied surface texture.</p>

            <h3><strong>Flavour</strong></h3>
            <p>While the condom was designed just to avoid unwanted pregnancy and to prevent STDs, condoms, nowadays, they can also be used to spice up lovemaking. One such things is flavoured condoms. They are actually designed to be used during oral sex.</p>
            <p>The flavoured coating helps mask the taste of latex and makes oral sex more enjoyable. More importantly, using condoms during oral sex is the only way to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections.</p>
            <p>Flavours such as mint, grape, orange, banana, strawberry, bubble-gum, chocolate, vanilla, bacon, and cola are available. Sometimes they are coloured to match the flavour.<br></p>
